# CSSgram

Instagram filter library in Sass and CSS.

## What is This?

Simply put, CSSgram is a library for editing your images with Instagram-like filters directly in CSS. What weâ€™re doing here is adding filters to the images as well as applying color and/or gradient overlays via various blending techniques to mimic these effects. This means *less manual image processing* and more fun filter effects on the web!

We are using pseudo-elements (i.e. `::before` and `::after`) to create the filter effects, so you must apply these filters on a containing element (i.e. not a *replaced element* like `<img>`). The recommendation is to wrap your images in a `<figure>` tag. More about the tag [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure).

## Browser Support

This library uses [CSS Filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) and [CSS Blend Modes](https://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/). These features are supported in the following browsers:

## Usage

**There are currently 2 ways to consume this library:**

### Use CSS classes

When using CSS classes, you can simply add the class with the filter name to the element containing your image.

  1. Include the CDN link in your `<head>` tag: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cssgram-cssgram.netdna-ssl.com/cssgram.min.css">`
  * Alternatively, you can [download the CSSgram library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/una/CSSgram/master/source/css/cssgram.min.css) locally and link to the it within your project: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/vendor/cssgram.min.css">`
  * Add a class to your image element with the name of the filter you would like to use

For example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<figure class="aden">
  <img src="../img.png">
</figure>
```

Alternatively, you can just download and link to any individual css file (e.g. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/vendor/aden.min.css">`), if youâ€™re just using one of the styles.

### Available Classes

_For use in HTML markup:_

*   Aden: `class="aden"`
*   Reyes: `class="reyes"`
*   Perpetua: `class="perpetua"`
*   Inkwell: `class="inkwell"`
*   Toaster: `class="toaster"`
*   Walden: `class="walden"`
*   Hudson: `class="hudson"`
*   Gingham: `class="gingham"`
*   Mayfair: `class="mayfair"`
*   Lo-fi: `class="lofi"`
*   X-Pro II: `class="xpro2"`
*   1977: `class="_1977"`
*   Brooklyn: `class="brooklyn"`
*   Nashville: `class="nashville"`
*   Lark: `class="lark"`
*   Moon: `class="moon"`
*   Clarendon: `class="clarendon"`
*   Willow: `class="willow"`

* * *

### Use Sass `@extend` or `@mixin`

If you use custom naming in your CSS architecture, you can add the `.scss` files for the provided styles within your project and then `@extend` the filter effects within your style definitions. If you think extends are stupid, I will fight you ðŸ˜Š.

1. [Download the `scss/` folder contents](https://github.com/una/CSSgram/tree/master/source/scss)
* Include a link to `scss/cssgram.scss` via an `@import` statement in your Sass manifest file (i.e. `main.scss`). It may look like: `@import 'vendor/cssgram'`
* Extend the placeholder selector (e.g. `@extend %aden` or using mixins `@include aden()`) in your element.

For example:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<figure class="viz--beautiful">
  <img src="../img.png">
</figure>
```

```sass
// Sass
.viz--beautiful {
  @extend %aden;
}
```

or using mixins (more flexible)

```
// Sass (without adding new CSS3 filters)
.viz--beautiful {
  @include aden();
}

// Sass (adding new CSS3 filters)
.viz--beautiful {
  @include aden(blur(2px) /*...*/);
}
```

Alternatively, you can just download and link any individual `.scss` file in your Sass manifest (i.e. `scss/aden.scss`), if you're just using one of the styles.

### Available Placeholders

*   Walden: `@extend %walden`

Filters are really fun to create! Reference photos created by [Miles Croxford](https://twitter.com/milescroxford) can be found [here](https://instagram.com/cssgram/).

## File Structure Outline

- `source/css/cssgram.css` contains each of the CSS classes you can apply to your `<img>` to give it the filter. You should use `source/css/cssgram.min.css` for production if you want access to all of the library
- `source/scss/` contains the source files for individual classes and placeholder selectors you can use to extend CSS classes in Sass
- `site/` is the public facing website
- `site/test` is how you test filters if you're developing, remember to change `is_done` for the filter you're creating in `site/filters.json`.

Note: this will also have mixin options and a PostCSS Component.
